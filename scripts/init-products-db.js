Synthetic Fibre, made from micro polyester and polypropylene, significantly enhances concrete performance by improving crack resistance, increasing tensile strength, and ensuring better bonding. It is specifically designed for projects facing repeated stress, temperature variations, and exposure to moisture. This fibre reinforcement is extensively used in industrial flooring, precast structures, tunnel linings, and road pavements to increase the durability and flexibility of concrete. </br></br> Recron¬Æ 3s can add muscle to concrete.  A specialty secondary reinforcement additive, Recron¬Æ 3s adds toughness and tensile strength to concrete, while helping resist shrinkage and cracking. It also bonds better with the mix, thanks to a unique triangular cross section and dimensional stability. <br><br>Developed after extensive research at the Reliance Technology Centre, Recron¬Æ 3s has been widely used in a variety of applications. You can be sure that it will add value to the special structures you build. <br><br>Accredited by leading industry bodies such as BIS, CPWD, PWD, MES, Railways, CRRI, IRC and NHAI.",
